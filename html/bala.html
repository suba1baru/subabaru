   <h2>Bala is an Indian film director, screenwriter, and film producer, working in Tamil cinema. Bala has been praised for "revolutionizing Tamil cinema"[2][3][4] through his realistic, dark and disturbing depiction of the working class on celluloid screen.[2][5] Shaji N. Karun, who headed the jury of the 56th National Film Awards, said, "Bala is unique in many ways. The way he changed Tamil cinema's character was commendable ... There were many who tried for a change. Among the new generation of filmmakers, Bala leads the pack in bringing a change in Tamil cinema's outlook and approach."</h2>
